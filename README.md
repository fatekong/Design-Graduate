Design for graduate
there are many algrorithm to realize function for spatial analyze included IDW ,Kriging ,TIN and Isoline.
IDW part include Inverse Distance Weight algrorithm and KDTree for KNN.
Kriging part include Ordinary Kriging algrorithm and Gauss-Newton fitting(but fitting used to have a weak result). 
Isoline by TIn part include TIN,Trace,modify,Polish.
Isoline by gird need Raster file.

And i have used some tools that are NetCDF and echarts to realize NetCDF file's Reading and chart's drawing.

By the way , Dotspatial is the master open source project to realize GIS functions.
